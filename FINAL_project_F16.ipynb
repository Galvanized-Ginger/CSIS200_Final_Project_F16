    "Once you find the average value, someone might ask you for the uncertainty (some people also refer to uncertainty as the \"*error*\") on your prediction. That can be tricky to calculate, so often what is given is just a *range* of possible values. \"We estimate the rainfall to be between X cm and Y cm.\" The question is, how to decide what that range is. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way this is often done is to find the middle 95% of the trial values (from your Monte Carlo run) and then use the low-edge and the high-edge of that range. If you're concerned about the middle 95%, then 2.5% of the values are below them and 2.5% of all the values are above them. The rainfall values at those edges are what you use for the ranges to quote. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is what people mean when they say, \"I'm 95% confident that the rainfall will be between X and Y\", and when you write it up for the LaTeX document, you should also quote it this way. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint!* This part becomes much easier if you sort all the values using any of the numpy/Python sort functions you can read about online. When you sort them, you should be able to find what rainfall is at the edge for the lower 2.5% and the higher 2.5%. "
